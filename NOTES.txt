The reason the memory on this is a bit funky, is because I just brain dumped
from the idea of Brainfuck, where it had a limited amount of memory. Ideally
one could remove these dumb constraints, and use a better mapping model.

The other thing about this is, with some modification, it could convert to
x86_64 architecture really nicely. You could convert the instructions to the
necessary opcodes and run a jmp to an mmap()'d region, or you could point a
function to an mmap()'d region and put the whole thing in a function. The jmp
would obviously allow it to be outside of the "function setup", but it would
have the same boundries as the calling function. Hopefully that made sense,
I'm kind of rambling now, it's just some ideas I had for this language.
