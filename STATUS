This code is mostly finished really (for a foundation)
I added an interface to create somewhat of a standard library, but that is not done.
(code is never finished, it can always be updated and made more efficient.)
It's complete at the hardware level though (as far as I know.)

I believe there is one memory leak in this code, somewhere in the stack tracing system,
but I haven't fixed it.

I wrote this is a night or so (it was just a brain dump.)
