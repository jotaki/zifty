16 "registers", r0,r1,r2,...,r15
active "register" is pointer to one of r0,r1,...
operator "registers" op0, and op1 is pointer to one of r0,r1,...
operand size influenced by op0sz, and op1sz

defaults to 32MB of memory on startup.
op0 -> r14, op0sz -> 8
op1 -> r15, op1sz -> 8
ar -> r0

stack segment points to the end of memory and grows down by sizeof(long).
default stack segment size is 16KB

function map starts at end of stack segment and grows down by 2*sizeof(long).
default function map size is 16KB

    ^       - pushes value of ar onto stack segment
    v       - pops value on stack segment into ar

  "string"  - loads 'string' into mem[mp], incrementing mp.
            - escape sequences supported are: \", \\, \n, and \xHEX
            - op0 is assigned the start address of "string"

            - ar is assigned the length of "string" (6)

 [ n n n ]  - Load array of integers n into memory of byte size opsz[0] each.
            - Uses opsz[0] as increment.
            - op0 is assigned the start address of the array
            - op1 is assigned the end address of the array
            - ar is assigned the length of the array.


    @       - call function in ar.

  {code}    - declares {code} as a function, the function number is in ar.

    !!bb    - use base bb as input base. Note: this only changes the multiplier to bb.
              Hex input will still be available. This does not effect
              operators. (eg, :11 wont work, you will still need to use :b)
	          a-f retain their values of 10-15. Likewise, increasing the base
	          does not expose more input characters. You will still be stuck
	          with 0-F (0-15) as the units value for a given base.
	          Setting !!00 will create the illusion of only having values 0-f.

     !(<N){code}   - For loop. This is the equivilent of doing something like:
                     for(*ar = *op0; *ar < N; *ar += *op1) { /* code */ }
     !(>N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use > comparison, (step is -= *op1)
     !(=N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use == comparison, (step is += *op1)
    !(<=N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use <= comparison, (step is += *op1)
    !(>=N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use >= comparison. (step is -= *op1)
    !(!=N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use != comparison, (step is += *op1)
    !(==N){code}   - For loop. Like above, but use == comparison. (step is -= *op1)
  !(<op>;R){code}  - For loop. Use current value of register R
 !(<op>;(R)){code} - For loop. Use value of register R. Keeping up with register R even if it changes.
